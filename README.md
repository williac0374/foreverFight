Like all my attmepts this code is based on [LostDecadeGames](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/), dont hold it against them.
Some functions are  "borrowed" from  [Tululoo Game Maker](http://tululoo.com/)  I programmed this in  my [GameJamEditor](https://github.com/williac0374/GameJamEditor/)
